# Word Scramble

This app is project 5 of "100 Days of SwiftUI". It has an array of words, one of which will be the root word displayed as the title. 
The text field takes as input a word which is: 

    1. longer than 2 letters
    2. a valid english word, which is checked using UITextChecker
    3. not the start word
    4. made of letters from the start word
    5. not already entered

The score is the sum of the letters of all the words entered.

The restart button sets the score to 0, removes all words entered and picks a new starting word.
